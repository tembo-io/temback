### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added the `--cd` option to switch to a directory before performing the backup.
*   Refactored the handling of the connection options and environment
    variables to avoid passing a password on the command-line, and to only set
    the values if they exist. This will allow backups without a username,
    password, or host name, or the equivalent `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, and
    `PGHOST` environment variables, while respecting those variables and
    options.
